Future Plans
:::
:::{.dd-box}

My interests in broad overlapping groups. These are the domains I'd like to expand in:

1. Physical systems \
[Condensed matter, non-equilbrium thermodynamics, electrochemical]{style="color:gray"}
1. Energy and Environment \
[Materials, policy]{style="color:gray"}
1. Computer simulations \
[ab initio, python/R]{style="color:gray"}
1. Modeling approaches \
[Mathematical, Stochastic, Bayesian, ML]{style="color:gray"}

Principally the aim is to employ 3 and 4 to gain insights in 1 and 2.
